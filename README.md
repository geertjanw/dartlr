# DESCRIPTION

Fully-featured ANTLR 3 parser generation for Dart.

ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition) is a tool that is used to generate
code for performing a variety of language recognition tasks: lexing, parsing,
abstract syntax tree construction and manipulation, tree structure recognition,
and input translation. The tool operates similarly to other parser generators,
taking in a grammar specification written in the special ANTLR metalanguage and
producing source code that implements the recognition functionality.

While the tool itself is implemented in Java, it has an extensible design that
allows for code generation in other programming languages. To implement an
ANTLR language target, a developer may supply a set of templates written in the
StringTemplate ([http://www.stringtemplate.org](http://www.stringtemplate.org)) language.

This dart lib is a complete implementation of the majority of features
ANTLR provides for other language targets, such as Java and Python. It contains:

* An extended version of the latest ANTLR program, bundling all necessary
  Java code and templates for producing fully featured language recognition
  in Dart code

* A dart runtime library that collects classes used throughout the code that
  ANTLR generates
   
* An antlr3 and an antlrworks jars, used to create the grammars and to generate
  code for performing a variety of language recognition tasks: lexing, parsing,
  abstract syntax tree construction and manipulation, tree structure recognition,
  and input translation.

# HOW TO BUILD

TODO

# USAGE

1. Write an ANTLR grammar specification for a language

   ```
   grammar SomeLanguage;
   
   options {
     language = Dart;    // <- this option must be set to Dart
     output   = AST;
   }
   
   top: expr ( ',' expr )*
     ;
    
   and so on...
   ```

2. Run the ANTLR tool with the `java -jar path/to/antlr3.jar` command to 
   generate output:
   
   ```
   java -jar path/to/antlr3.jar SomeLanguage.g
   # creates:
   #   SomeLanguageParser.dart
   #   SomeLanguageLexer.dart
   #   SomeLanguage.tokens
   ```

   NOTES: Probably you will need to edit the `#import` directive in the 
	  lexer and parser generated to reflect your local path.
	 
	  More samples can be found in the tests folder.

3. Try out the results directly:

 ```dart
 #import("path/to/DartLRLib.dart");

  main() {
  
    var lexer = new SomeLanguageLexer(charStream);
    var tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);
    var parser = new SomeLanguageParser(tokens);
  
    var result = parser.<entry_rule>();
    
    ...
    
  }
  ```
